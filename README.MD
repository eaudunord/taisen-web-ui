This is a simple Web UI for controlling the Taisen Netplay script on a DreamPi

To install:
- Place install.sh in a folder on your DreamPi
- Make it executable with the command `sudo chmod +x install.sh`
- Use the command `./install.sh` to begin the installation. 

An alternate automated installer for Windows users can be found here:
